# Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) in C++

## Description

This project implements an Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) system using C++. It utilizes FFmpeg for audio processing and employs efficient algorithms for extracting and matching audio fingerprints. The goal is to enable fast and accurate identification of audio and video content.

## Features

- Audio fingerprint extraction using advanced signal processing techniques.
- Fast insertion and retrieval of fingerprints with high precision and recall.
- Support for various audio formats via FFmpeg.
- Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (3.10 or later)
- FFmpeg (installed via Homebrew, APT, or compiled from source)
